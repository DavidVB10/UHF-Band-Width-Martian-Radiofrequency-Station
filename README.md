Maxwell equations' simulation with contour conditions imposed by a parabolic antenna characterized by some free parameters to be determinated. This parabolic antenna is located (taking into account all electromagnetic parameters) on Mars surface, and it is seen as part of a larger radiofrecuency station operating on the UHF band witdh used for communications between Mars and the Earth.

Repository is composed of two main scripts. One in which the antenna is operating receiving e.m. waves coming from Earth (antenna_reception.py), and one in which the antenna is operating sending e.m. waves to the Earth (antenna_emission.py). It also has png and jpg images of the simulations (2D simulations and polar graphs of waves emision and reception) as well as a paper (written in spanish) including an explanation of all fixed parameters choices, physical fundamentation of the simuations among other things.
